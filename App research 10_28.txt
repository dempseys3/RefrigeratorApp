I have been researching on how to send notifications to app users so later we can implement sending notifications to users when their food items are about to expire. Through my research I have found that a broadcast receiver might be best to send the notification, however the app user would possibly have to register/ allow notifications to be sent to their device. 


Along with researching notifications, I also began lightly researching how to communicate with multiple devices/ app users for our shopping list feature. On the Android Developers website there’s an article on the android.bluetooth class which may be the best way for our app to be able to communicate with multiple users. There is also a way to create a server interface using the internet through the use of Sockets. This may be more reliable than the bluetooth since bluetooth devices need to be in close proximity to each other.
